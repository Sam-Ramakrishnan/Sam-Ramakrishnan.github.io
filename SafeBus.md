## SafeBus

**Project description:** While working at Rain Concert Technologies, I designed and developed the Android application module of the [SafeBus](http://safebus.vsafehs.com/) bus tracking system. The system monitors the movement of buses, their speeds, locations covered, traffic blocks, and sends alerts to parents/users for violations, speeding, or deviations from the normal route. The system has been adopted by various schools in Trivandrum (population: 1.6 million).
