## MHealth Tanzania

**Project description:** I worked on the mobile application module of this system to track the efficiency of drugs for malaria in Tanzania while working at Rain Concert. Rain Concert developed this system in conjunction with University of Notre Dame and NIMR (Tanzania). I used SQLite to store data locally in-app and RESTful services to exchange data with the back-end endpoints developed by the web team. I also used an Android Service to auto-upload data from the app DB to the server in case the health worker doesn't have access to the internet during their visits. The research based on this system published by NIMR and the University of Notre Dame can be found [here.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5540449/)
