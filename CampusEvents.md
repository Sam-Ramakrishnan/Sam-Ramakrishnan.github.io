## Campus Events

**Project description:** Worked with my team to develop this Android App. The app allowed students to add events they are hosting and see events hosted by others. Users could do these functionalities via a list or a map. Used aws, python, and SQL for the back end. Used RESTful web services to transfer data between the app and the back end.
