## Campus Events

**Project description:** I worked with a team to develop this Android App for a class project. The app allows students to add events they are hosting and see events hosted by others. Users could do these functionalities via a list or a map. We developed the backend using AWS, python, and SQL. We used RESTful web services to transfer data between the app and the back end.
